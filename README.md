Reworking an old ActionScript experiment I did 10 years ago with Javascript and CSS Transforms. The goal is to make a canvas version in the near future. Each instance of the PointLux class reacts to the pointer position, scaling and rotating accordingly.

This experiment uses mathematical equations to determine the distance between two points and the angle formed by a line and the X axis. It also uses jQuery Pointer Events Polyfill to normalize mouse and touch events.
